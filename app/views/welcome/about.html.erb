      <p>We are dedicated to the makers, the creators, the risk-takers. We wake up in the middle of the night and furiously write down ideas to make your online life better.</p>
      <p>When we're not hard at work, we're hard at play-we're the loud ones at the bar and we're always shutting the place down. Human communication and collaboration is what drives us, and infuses every feature of gCamp. </p>
