  <h4>What is gCamp?</h4>
  <p></p>
  <p></p>
  <p>gCamp is an awesome tool that is going to change your life. gCamp is your one stop shop to organize all your
  tasks and documents. You'll also be able to track comments that you and others make. gCamp may eventually replace
  all need for paper and pens in the entire world. Well, maybe not, but it's going to be pretty cool.

  <p></p>
  <h4>How do I join gCamp?</h4>
  <p></p>
  <p></p>
  <p>Right now, gCamp is still in development.So there is not a sign-up page open to the public, yet! Your best option
  is to become super best friends with a developer. They can be found hanging around gSchool during the day and at the
  hottest clubs at night.

  <h4>When will gCamp be finished?</h4>
  <p></p>
  <p></p>
  <p>gCamp is a work in progress. That being said, it should be fully functional by December 2014. Functional, but our
  developers are going to continue to improve the sight for the foreseeable future. Check in daily for new features
  and new functionality. It's going to blow your mind. Organization is only (well, will only) be a click away.
  Amazing!
